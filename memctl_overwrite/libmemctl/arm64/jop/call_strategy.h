/*
 * jop_call_build_fn
 *
 * Description:
 * 	A function to build a JOP payload and set up arguments to kernel_call_7.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 		func			The kernel function to call.
 * 		args			The arguments to the kernel function. The first 8 arguments
 * 					are passed in registers, the remaining arguments are passed
 * 					on the stack. The arguments have already been preprocessed
 * 					by kernel_call_arm64, so the implementation may assume that
 * 					all arguments are 64-bit words.
 * 		kernel_payload		The address of the payload in the kernel.
 * 	out	payload			On return, the JOP payload. This will be copied into the
 * 					kernel at address jop_payload.
 * 	out	initial_state		On return, the state of the CPU registers to set at the
 * 					start of JOP execution.
 * 	out	result_address		On return, the address of the result value.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 	The args array will be long enough to hold the 8 arguments passed in registers and however
 * 	many arguments are supported by the implementation's stack limit. For example, if the
 * 	jop_call_strategy specifies that stack_size is 48 bytes, this corresponds to 6 64-bit
 * 	stack arguments, and hence the args array will be of length 14.
