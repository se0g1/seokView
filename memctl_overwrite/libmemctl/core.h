 * Returns:
 * 	True if the core was successfully loaded.

 * Errors:
 * 	core_error			A core-specific error condition was encountered.
 * 	...				Other errors
 *
 * Notes:
 * 	It is safe to call this function multiple times.
 *
 * 	libmemctl provides the API for obtaining the kernel task port so that each core depends
 * 	only on libmemctl, regardless of what client program is using it.
