 *
 * Parameters:
 * 		str			The string to search.
 * 		len			The maximum length of the string.
 * 		ch			The character to search for.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	A pointer to the first occurrence of the character in the string, or NULL if the character
 * 	was not found.

 *
 * Returns:
 * 	The numeric value of the digit, or -1 if the character is not a valid hexadecimal digit.

/*
 * strtoint
 *
 * Description:
 * 	Parse the given string into an integer.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 		str			The string to parse.
 * 		len			The maximum length of the string.
 * 		sign			If sign is true, then the string representation of the
 * 					integer may optionally start with a "+" or "-" to indicate
 * 					the sign.
 * 		is_signed		Whether the integer to parse is signed or unsigned. This
 * 					affects overflow detection.
 * 		base			The base to parse the integer, if no base prefix is
 * 					present in the string.
 * 	out	value			On return, the integer value that was parsed.
 * 	out	end			On return, the first character that wasn't parsed. If the
 * 					entire string was parsed, then end will point to the null
 * 					terminator.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	A strtoint_result code.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 	The following base prefixes are recognized by this function:
 * 		0x	Hexadecimal (base 16)
 * 		0o	Octal (base 8)
 * 		0b	Binary (base 2)
 *
 * 	Unfortunately the choice of 0b for binary may lead to unexpected results, since "b" is a
 * 	valid hexadecimal digit. For example, trying to parse the string "0b10" with base set to 16
 * 	will actually return the value 2, not 0xB10, since the leading "0b" will be recognized as
 * 	the base specifier.
