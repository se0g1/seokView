/*
 * Kernel and kernel extension routines.
 *
 * The kernel subsystem maintains a mapping of bundle identifiers to kext structs. Each kext struct
 * stores basic information about the kernel extension (or pseudoextension): the runtime address,
 * the runtime slide, the kext's Mach-O file, the symbol table, etc. This mapping is initialized in
 * kernel_init(). When kernel_kext() is called for a kext that has not yet been initialized, it is
 * added to the mapping. Subsequent calls to kernel_kext will return this previously-created
 * object. kernel_deinit() will free this mapping, and all kext objects will be invalidated.
